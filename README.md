# Learning Rust
Repo to follow along "The Rust Programming Language" book

## Notes

### Cargo
- create a project using `cargo new`
- build a project using `cargo build` (`cargo build --release` to compile it with optimizations)
- build and run a project in one step using `cargo run`
- build a project without producing a binary to check for errors using `cargo check`
